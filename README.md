# hello-world

Hello!

I'm Gustavo, a Materials Engineer experienced in quality control of maintenance services in the Oil & Gas industry. I've had a few classes of programming during college but it was only an introduction. I've learned a lttle bit of C++ and MathLab at the time. In the early 2018 I've made some spreadsheets using VBA wich really helped me. Recently i've found a need for better communication between our crew and agile data search. My best thought was building an App for this purpose and I've decided to do it myself.
I'm learning React-Native and web development right now to make this project, and right from the beggining i've realized that i really enjoy programming. 

Greetings from Brazil to all, hope to learn and share a lot here!
